- Node Modules?

in Javascript every file is node module

add.js
require('./first.js')
function add(a,b){
    return a+b;
}
console.log(add(1,4));
--
first.js
function hello(){
    console.log("first node  program--"); 
}
hello();
----

require('./fileName.js') is used to call function of other file.

By default file(module) is incapsulated, so if we need to use that file function in another file then
we can use 
module.exports= function name add(1(which function we want to use in another js file)
